[Verse 1]
If you want to dance, and play, and paint and sing
You can come to my house
The idea is to take part, you will have fun
If you want to come to my house
I want to invite to my house
All of m	y girl friends, and boy friends
I want to jump and dance
And share what I have with you

[Chorus]
Chipi-chipi, chapa-chapa
Dubi-dubi, daba-daba
Magical my dubi-dubi-dú, dú, dú, dú
Chipi-chipi, chapa-chapa
Dubi-dubi, daba-daba
Magical my dubi-dubi-dú

[Verse 2]
If you want to sing, I will show you
If you want to come to my house
I’ll tell my mom to tell your mom
To let you come to my house
I have a doll that was gifted to me
That if you give a baby bottle, it doesn’t cry (it doesn’t cry)
And in my notebook there’s a song
That we we’re al	l gonna sing now
